###<--- Compute the proportion of variance explained
# the above analysis produces variance component estimates (e.g., $\sigma^2_b$ for batch effect) that are based on a penalized maximum likelihood approach. We compute naive approximation of sum of squared variation for the individual effect and for the batch effect, and their proportions of variation. Specifically, to simplify the computations of degrees of freedom for each factor, we approximate a balanced nested design and compute estiamted number of levels of each factor as the average of the observed number of levels of each factor: the approximate number of batches is 2.67 (i.e., (2+3+3)/3) and and the approximate number of cell is 70.5 (i.e., average number of cell samples per batch).
