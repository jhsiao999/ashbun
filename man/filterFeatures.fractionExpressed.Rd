qualified as "detected as expressed".}

\item{fractionExpressed}{fraction of samples qualified as detected as expressed.}

\item{control}{List with the following arguments
\code{plot} TRUE/FALSE to output diagnositic plot.}
}
\value{
List of the following objects
   \code{fraction_expressed} fraction of samples qualified as "expressed".
   \code{index_filter} TRUE/FALSE passing the filter.
