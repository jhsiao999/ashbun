}
\arguments{
\item{counts}{Gene by sample expression count matrix (G by N).}
}
\value{
\code{libsize_factors} numeric vector of the scale factors for library size.

\description{
DESeq was used to implement RLE. Note that we chose to use the implementation by
             the developer of the method. edgeR also implments a version of RLE, which gives 
             different results: (calcNormFactors(method = "RLE"))
}
